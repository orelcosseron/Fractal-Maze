# Fractal-Maze

Inspired by [this question](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/37675/alice-and-the-fractal-hedge-maze), which is also used as the default maze. 

To launch the game, simply run:
    python ./main.py

The game is played using ZQSD (French Keyboard Layout), you can customize the keys in `keyPressEvent` in `main.py` and `update_player` in `maze.py`.

To create your own fractal maze, you simply have to edit the `labyrinth` file using the pseudocode described in it.
